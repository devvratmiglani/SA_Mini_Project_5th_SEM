"Once again thank you to everyone, I would literally not be here without you",1
to say that I'm very happy is a severe understatement,1
every single person I talked to at that place was so nice and understanding and perfect,1
and all of this isn't going to cost me anything,1
I have a safe place to go and talk with other LGBT people every day if I need/want,1

MY PARENTS ARE LITERALLY WEEBS AND THEYVE BEEN HIDING THEIR POWERLEVEL ALL THIS TIME HOW DID I NOT NOTICE,1
IM LIKE MOM YOU REALISE WHO YOU JUST DREW? AND SHE LIKE YEAH ONE OF THOSE BOATGIRLS,1
AND SHE DRAWS FUCKING SHIMAKAZE'S OUTFIT ,1
I ask her what her fav outfit was and she says she doesn't know the name of the girl but she can draw it,1
"then I ask how she knew about cosplay and she says ""I really like anime girl outfits and I used to cosplay myself""",1
she says 2 weeks AND THAT SHE'LL DO IT FOR FREE,1
so we talk out all the details and she says she'll even make me her thighhigh boots and glasses and then I ask how long it'll take her,1
then she pulls up a paper and starts drawing her outfit and asking me all these questions about it ,1
at that point I started freaking out like she actually knows homura and all the megukas,1
"now I ask if she'd make me a cosplay of homura and she says ""is that the emo girl from the madoka anime?""",1
turns out my mom is a total weeb,1
she took out her iPad and showed me a collection of manga and anime and Love Live of all things,1
"I asked if she knew what cosplaying was and she said yes, then I asked if she was familiar with anime and she got really offended",1
already was pretty happy about that but I decided to test her promise and her sewing skills,1
at the end of the talk she says she fully accepts who I am and will support me in any way possible and a year before she kicked me out,1
its late night and she starts asking me about a bunch of trans stuff and I just answer her honestly,1
the reason I was supposed to go see my mom was she wanted to talk to me about something face to face,1
I was already in awe over that but the day got even better,1
I asked him about it and he said hes really into 90s anime and jp culture,1
"turns out my dad has a whole collection of doujins under his bed, mostly from the 90s",1
as I walk into my dads bedroom to get my clothes I turn to look at him and he's literally reading a doujin,1
so I'm about to leave to my moms house but I realised I'd probably stay there for 2 nights instead of one so I decided to get extra clothes,1
this is the same story I tried to tell last week but I didn't because I was feeling horrible,1
I have to wait until 14 for my appointment so story time,1

Laiqalasse VeganRevoIution I kno plenty of people who love animals and still eat them.theres a better way though.morals aligning w/beliefs,1
Laiqalasse VeganRevoIution cognitive dissonance.We're conditioned to love certain animals as pets and certain are food.its diff everywhere,1
Laiqalasse VeganRevoIution if u care more about cows than people I want you to know you don't have to eat them.That's moral schizophrenia,1
Laiqalasse VeganRevoIution see you still have compassion left! You don't need to eat animals to survive :) let them keep their sparkle,1

Laiqalasse VeganRevoIution for veal. Milked til they can't anymore and are useless. Confined,1
Laiqalasse VeganRevoIution so did the cows tell you themselves they want to be artificially inseminated. Birth calves to be taken away,1
Laiqalasse VeganRevoIution you kill things you love? The family pet? Your little sister? You can't love someone and then kill them,1
Laiqalasse VeganRevoIution and what is actually disgusting is the abuse torture and killing of animals.,1
Laiqalasse VeganRevoIution its not saying oh anyone w an eating disorder is a bad person. Showing you that they don't need to abuse back,1
Laiqalasse VeganRevoIution no. People can overcome eating disorders without eating meat (abusing animals),1
Laiqalasse VeganRevoIution you can defend a human abuse victim while still believing they shouldn'tbe abusing animals.actually makes sense,1
Laiqalasse VeganRevoIution then you might relate to the animals being abused a little more one would think. I speak up for those who can't,1

GenevieveVerso MissLusyd I haven't but I've been diagnosed with clinical depression,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd it's super hard sometimes though,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso yes. Dwelling on the positive is much more fun,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd haha. I'd have to do some more research. I'm gonna be a history major next semester so this is like porn to me,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd it was only like three generations ago so at pretty recentish,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd idk but y'know. It makes sense.,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd yeah well that's why my mom's side doesn't drink.,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd that's all I know but when I found out I was like wow I come from class.,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd uh well. Because my great grandpa's dad made moonshine during Prohibition and they wanted to get away from that,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso funny story it's why my maternal grandma's dad's family relocated from AL to AR,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd though tbh I'm descended from illegal moonshine makers so I dunno how I ended up being such a lightweight,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso I have Irish in me but not enough apparently.,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso oh god an entire bottle would knock me out cold.,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso probably don't wanna know.,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd hangover was not worth it man. Never drank since.,1
"GenevieveVerso MissLusyd yeah. I once went to a fancy restaurant, barely drank a thing. My friend had to steady me back to the car.",1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd I can get tipsy after a sip of white wine. So yeah. I am.,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd I've never actually experienced whiskey.,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso I have a kerig or however you spell it,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd eh well I made it a few hours ago. It was too hot for hot coffee earlier.,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso this coffee is actually making me sleepy.,1
"GenevieveVerso MissLusyd besides the reign of Michael Ann, kitchen Nazi is almost over. Thankfully.",1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd well I have coffee it'll have to replace alcohol.,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd no. My family celebrates it on Christmas Eve because my dad works on Christmas,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso this conversation has happened at least three times today.,1
"GenevieveVerso ""Paige you aren't doing this right"" ""then why don't YOU do it Michael Ann?"" ""I'm helping mom with dinner"" Helllllp",1
GenevieveVerso idk my sister is being the buzzkill of the kitchen right now.,1
GenevieveVerso unless you're my family where everyone is sober. Haha. ,1

GenevieveVerso MissLusyd yes. perfect timing. While you're at it pick names too. ,1
"MissLusyd GenevieveVerso that is a neon red flag. Yeah. Never use babies as an opening line, guys.",1
He looks so done tbh. ,1
"GenevieveVerso MissLusyd it was the ""have my babies"" that set off the red flag for me. Heellll no.",1
Preseeeents. ,1
techiem2 a bit. He's very proud of that remote though.,1
Sleepy kitty ,1
"Yes, she's grooming him too and he thinks it's the cutest thing ever. I love watching my dad with Tali. It's really adorable.",1

Welp. After the blood bank I stumbled upon I decided I've had enough of bugs tonight. Anyone doing anything fun?,1
This game has been potting bugs at me for the past hour. Bring it.,1
Miralurks scare me but not as much as those giant ass mosquitos,1
I hate giant bugs. Why does it always have to be giant bugs?,1
Finally hit level 50. Score.,1
MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos ouch. Even I'm not that cruel.,1
MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos make Danny carry some.,1
MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos look. You won the dirty Shakespeare contest. Take the damn crown already.,1
azarkansero TheFuxedos not it..oh shit.,1
azarkansero TheFuxedos well actually it's be impossible since there's a mean dog guarding goodneighbor. Not that I made someone try...,1
azarkansero TheFuxedos yeah you'd have to play more than five minutes to actually get to Hancock.,1
"Nowacking: If you're working retail the next few days, you have my sympathy and I love you and be strong, people are awful &lt;3",1
I could just fall asleep right now but I don't wanna mess up my sleep schedule already,1
MissLusyd I'll be fine. I just need to not think about my job for 11 days.,1
MissLusyd dude I don't even drink and today made me want to start.,1
"While I was away, my sister had succeeded in getting Hancock as a companion and stealing his outfit.",1
"""So I've been getting a lot of dresses and I think everyone's just gonna wear dresses eventually"" doodle_thebug",1
We shouldn't be treated like this especially since we were just doing our jobs.,1
I am so stressed out now for me and my coworker's mental well being. Seriously. In the 4 years I've known her I've never seen her cry.,1
I am *so* sick of being perceived as not doing anything when I do everything I'm told and more. It drives me insane.,1
"I mean it's not like I made three lists, restocked the entire candy section and dusted the entire store. Pshh.",1
BUT since we made her wait thirty minutes for our pizza I apparently did NOTHING for the past few days except sit on my ass.,1
and seriously I tried my hardest to have everything done on her damn list by the time she got there. And it was to an extent.,1
BUT. Apparently since we made her wait thirty minutes to get our pizza that was all invalidated. We didn't do anything. Allegedly.,1
We ended up making about $300 in thirty minutes and that was pretty cool.,1
I mean EVERYONE decided to come in at that time and people were super needy and we were doing the best we could tbh.,1
She was supposed to pick up pizza and we were supposed to order it but we got slammed and there was no way for us to get to the phones.,1
Anyway. My boss made my coworker cry and me pissed beyond belief.,1
ughh...yeah shit just hit the fan.,1
UGH MY BOSS IS LETTING US CLOSE AT 1:30! MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ME,1
Poor cleaning lady. :( ,1
Retail hell is extra hellish today. Wheee.,1
Megafighter3 Sad thing is her bed is my bed. She has her own side of the bed and everything.,1
I kinda wanna go to bed but I don't want to become that person who goes to bed too early. Also idk if Princess Tali will let me sleep.,1

techiem2 we have signs. we have highlighted signs. These people have been shopping with us for years. THEY KNOW about the fees.,1
this drives me insane. Seriously.,1
"The cafeteria ALSO charges extra for low transactions. We do not, hence the limit. We would make no money off a $1.75 purchase on a card.",1
The cafeteria jacked up their prices. We did not. They can do whatever they want since they raised to mirror the bank fees.,1
I will explain. We would not make any money off a low transaction because the bank fees are too damn high.,1
"so when I say ""We're not the cafeteria. I can't put $1.75 on your card"""" do NOT give me the bitchface.",1
GenevieveVerso TheFuxedos nah nevermind. I deleted it. my feed is lying to me.,1
why do people think we're gonna follow the rules of the hospital cafeteria? They're not state run. We are We still enforce the $3 card limit,1
GenevieveVerso we don't sell enough books.,1
GenevieveVerso ..which is why I'm going home today early and doing all that crap tomorrow.,1
"GenevieveVerso Yeahhh. She wants me to go from shelf to shelf, left to right top to bottom and restock everything. fml",1

"azarkansero MissLusyd TheFuxedos GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 Tauri3l I have trouble saying ""Asiago""",1
FINALLY got Valentine's companion perk. Welp. Time to stop playing for today.,1
azarkansero MissLusyd TheFuxedos GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 Tauri3l actually northwest Louisiana but AR sounded less dignified.,1
azarkansero MissLusyd TheFuxedos GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 Tauri3l oh that too. I was thinking of the south Arkansas dialect,1
azarkansero MissLusyd TheFuxedos GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 Tauri3l here in the south we call them spuds. Because we can't say potato,1
MissLusyd TheFuxedos liz_smith333 GenevieveVerso Tauri3l like I said last night babies don't know how to people yet.,1
NoahClue it's quite adorable they snuggle and everything. It's the other cats she has problems with.,1
NoahClue actually she did have a twin but I couldn't get her. And FYI the puppy looooves her.,1
Kisses! ,1
She's still cute as a button though. ,1
Princess Tali has tummy problems. :(((,1
It's late night weird documentary searching time! Yay!,1
GenevieveVerso Tauri3l MissLusyd liz_smith333 TheFuxedos night night.,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso Tauri3l liz_smith333 I think it's my best work. ,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso Tauri3l liz_smith333 TheFuxedos omg one sec,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso Tauri3l liz_smith333 TheFuxedos can I send him badly drawn pictures of boobs instead?,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso Tauri3l liz_smith333 TheFuxedos I DONT.,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso Tauri3l liz_smith333 TheFuxedos poor guy.,1
Tauri3l MissLusyd GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 TheFuxedos I'm sure modifications are available,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso nothingalarming TheFuxedos I have an album saved on Spotify but i have yet to listen to it. Next delivery run.,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd nothingalarming TheFuxedos what did they ever do to you!?,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso nothingalarming TheFuxedos you must! For the kittens.,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso nothingalarming TheFuxedos LEAVE THE KITTENS OUT OF THIS ,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso nothingalarming TheFuxedos bit of both really.,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso nothingalarming TheFuxedos stayed for the weird ass conversations.,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso nothingalarming TheFuxedos I'm just here for the lols.,1
"MissLusyd nothingalarming TheFuxedos GenevieveVerso yeah the mayor doesn't need his ego stroked too much. He gets ""ideas""",1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd liz_smith333 TheFuxedos Tauri3l ..did I say something wrong?,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 TheFuxedos Tauri3l dude I'm just upset because it would've made a great story,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd liz_smith333 TheFuxedos Tauri3l Bethesda is kink shaming me.,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd liz_smith333 TheFuxedos Tauri3l WHY WONT NICK LOVE ME,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd liz_smith333 TheFuxedos Tauri3l tbh he was my second choice. My first choice was unavailable *sobs*,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 MissLusyd TheFuxedos Tauri3l I'd do* damn phone.,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 MissLusyd TheFuxedos Tauri3l is so it with you I I knew the terms.,1
liz_smith333 GenevieveVerso MissLusyd TheFuxedos Tauri3l he comes and goes. It's a thing.,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 MissLusyd TheFuxedos Tauri3l also the different communities and gangs also have a different set of morals,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 MissLusyd TheFuxedos Tauri3l also the different communities and gangs also have a different set of morals,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 MissLusyd TheFuxedos Tauri3l dude I've been thinking about this while I play.,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 MissLusyd TheFuxedos Tauri3l I could actually use fallout as an example with factions and such.,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 MissLusyd TheFuxedos Tauri3l different societies have different concepts of right and wrong.,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 MissLusyd TheFuxedos Tauri3l well of course. A moral compass is constructed by society.,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 MissLusyd TheFuxedos Tauri3l but still!,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 MissLusyd TheFuxedos Tauri3l it could go both ways. Babies don't know how to people yet.,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd liz_smith333 TheFuxedos Tauri3l she took it to the place where it needed to go. GENIUS.,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 TheFuxedos Tauri3l holy shit you're right,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l anyway have we fully defined twat nugget yet?,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l not to mention an entire wall of pens.,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l we have a wide selection of chocolate and energy bars.,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l dude it is. Our candy section is ridiculously massive and it takes all day.,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l I should be shelving books not act as a living vending machine.,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l restocking candy is mine. I work in a med school bookstore.,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l oh you poor girl. I'm actually pretty lucky as far as retail jobs go tbh.,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l sales and clearance racks are my own personal brand of hell.,1
"GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l I work retail, I'm well aware there is no escape.",1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l those who put their money on the counter and leave...,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l I always stayed home where ya safe from the twat nuggets,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l thank god I work for the state and my store never has to do Black Friday.,1
liz_smith333 TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l GenevieveVerso you started this oh great leader,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l aka what should be common sense but isn't.,1
"GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l nah, since it's a philosophy by a religion. We don't worship the twat nugget",1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd liz_smith333 TheFuxedos Tauri3l a good number of my customers are twat nuggets.,1
GenevieveVerso liz_smith333 TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l I might adhere to the twat nugget philosophy. It sounds very wise.,1
It's so rare that all four of us are here upstairs. Tali has so many people to smell during the movie.,1
"GenevieveVerso TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l Plato, Betham, Mills. Got it.",1
Finally convinced dad that we only needed to watch the original trilogy. Success.,1
GenevieveVerso TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l I've never actually studied it. I probably will eventually. Sounds like my kinda thing.,1
Nick Valentine better get max approval after this damn quest. I DESERVE IT,1
Running backwards and shooting aimlessly is a strategy I use waaaay too often.,1
GenevieveVerso TheFuxedos MissLusyd Tauri3l I may not know anything about the subject but damn I'll try to contribute.,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd Tauri3l TheFuxedos do I really want to answer that?,1
MissLusyd Tauri3l TheFuxedos GenevieveVerso only way accepted.,1
"MissLusyd Tauri3l TheFuxedos GenevieveVerso sometimes you gotta go deep, man.",1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd TheFuxedos Welp. I'm powerless.,1
GenevieveVerso TheFuxedos MissLusyd which I don't. They tried that a few years back didn't stick.,1
MissLusyd TheFuxedos GenevieveVerso ahhhh if only it were that simple.,1
TheFuxedos MissLusyd GenevieveVerso actually completely impossible to be honest.,1
MissLusyd TheFuxedos GenevieveVerso eh. It honestly is what we make of it. My beliefs are kinda hard to summarize.,1
MissLusyd TheFuxedos GenevieveVerso Same actually. Twitter is not made for theological discussions,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd TheFuxedos wait I do. So God's will is chair fights?,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd TheFuxedos ...I legit do not know how to respond to that.,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd TheFuxedos so classy because divine beings can do whatever they want? Pshh,1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso TheFuxedos cmon now surely it'd be classier than that. Surely.,1
MissLusyd TheFuxedos I know. I work in retail. I KNOW.,1
GenevieveVerso if I were truly bright I wouldn't have gotten so lost in this stupid game just now.,1
TheFuxedos another one? I thought that event was last thanksgiving.,1
GenevieveVerso oh pshh. Not really.,1
GenevieveVerso yeah once I get one of those fancy Masters degrees I can move out. Only just got an associates so it'll be awhile.,1
GenevieveVerso I say I'm independent while living rent free at my parents house so eh?,1
GenevieveVerso what can I say I'm an independent woman?,1
GenevieveVerso eh. I'll just try to get one of those degree things and see if I can get one of those job things,1
GenevieveVerso yeah. I'm fresh out of those.,1
GenevieveVerso I dot actually get too much attention. Mostly because I don't go anywhere.,1
GenevieveVerso yeah the big blue doe eyes don't exactly help with scariness.,1
GenevieveVerso yeah. We seem to be in the same boat. I'm actually 5'2 and look barely legal so if you actually have an arsenal can we share,1
GenevieveVerso scary guy friends are a must while out in public,1
GenevieveVerso aaaaand this is why I don't interact with people outside the Internet.,1
MissLusyd not too much a pie person. Or a tea person. I have very plain tastes.,1
MissLusyd is it sweet and delicious?,1
MissLusyd I don't drink but that looks amazing.,1
GenevieveVerso daw thanks. ~&lt;3,1
GenevieveVerso personally I think I look like I'm 12 but y'know.,1
GenevieveVerso eh. Like I said I'm mostly doing this for my health.,1
GenevieveVerso I'm not. I'm jus really really short and 170 may not be a lot to some people but I SHOULD be 125,1
GenevieveVerso dude I'm not one of them. I've never broken a bone in my life.,1
GenevieveVerso actually there's a legit reason: I broke my toe last year by standing on it. My bones can't handle being this heavy.,1
GenevieveVerso but I COULD have a perfect ass and be even cuter.,1
GenevieveVerso it's the booty. I need to get rid of it. ,1
"GenevieveVerso that's sweet but I am on the chubby side and my body needs to be thinner to be healthy. Delicate bones, y'see.",1
ProfessorOtaku too pure...too precious for this world.,1
ProfessorOtaku ...look I am well aware that I am tiny and chubby but I can have dreams.,1
ProfessorOtaku DO YOU NOT BELIEVE ME,1
One of these days I will do enough sit ups to have abs of steel. *sigh* why is exercising so haaaaaaard,1
No snuggles until princess Tali has filled her quota of kitty fetch. No sleeping either unless you want your face licked,1
Princess Tali DEMANDS to play kitty fetch. Or else she will make sad crying noises.,1
PikaHikariKT they're all in my bed somewhere.,1
Tali keeps stealing my hair ties for kitty fetch to the point where I have none because she has lost most of them.,1
No it doesn't matter what you're doing or what time it is. You will play Kitty fetch when Kitty wants to play Kitty fetch.,1
Tauri3l MissLusyd azarkansero blech,1
MissLusyd not to mention most likely fatal. HEYO.,1
MissLusyd oh god. I dunno. Can we really top car fucking?,1
MissLusyd good! Now we can move on to something more fun!,1
MissLusyd just remember not everyone sucks. I know it's hard. Especially since I've cut myself off from actual people,1
MissLusyd I don't *actually* follow my own advice though.,1
MissLusyd am I sounding preachy? I just like helping people.,1
MissLusyd you should carry yourself in a way as such. Like you shouldn't change anything except how you think about yourself.,1
"MissLusyd well the way I see it, if you *think* everyone thinks that, there's a possibility they do. Fuck them. You ARE a person and-",1
MissLusyd it could be. Personally I think it looks awesome but different is treated differently by the public,1
MissLusyd I hate people sometimes.,1
Tauri3l MissLusyd tear him to pieces. Then screenshot it and show us.,1
"MissLusyd seriously? If you don't mind me asking, why?",1
MissLusyd we all have our coping mechanisms. And I think no human being should treat another like shit but eh? life happens.,1
MissLusyd I bet. Destroying men's concept of existence sounds so badass tbh.,1
"MissLusyd ahh yes. I wasn't too good at messing with them, my trolling techniques are too uncreative. I'm sure you're a master at it.",1
MissLusyd yeah after the 50thish one I was bored. It's like the same guy was messaging me from different accounts,1
"MissLusyd I always got the ""lonely gamer"" types.",1
MissLusyd mine was too at first but it stopped being funny after a few months so I stopped.,1
MissLusyd see that's why I left those sites years ago. I am a weird creepy guy magnet as well.,1
MissLusyd oh god. That's terrifying.,1
LonerDreamer eh that and messing with mccready seem to be doing it for her,1
LonerDreamer well she just got done with finals. I think she's exercising pent up rage. It's hard being an engineering major apparently,1
"LonerDreamer she also ditches him frequently and ""accidentally"" shoots him. Yet she won't change companions for some reason",1
LonerDreamer also everytime he complains about her hoarding she changes his outfit and gives him all her junk.,1
LonerDreamer yeah I vaguely remember him in fallout 3. It's been a few years but it's really recent for her. The memories are still fresh,1
LonerDreamer PikaHikariKT I shudder at the thought of if she finds one even more ridiculous looking.,1
tskimoongoddess I'm too nice to do that. Such a shame.,1
tskimoongoddess she's just incredibly tacky with looting and extorting caps. Also underleveled like 70% of the time.,1
"PikaHikariKT also she does a lot of other stuff to him too. Push him off lifts, dress him in bright clothes, etc.",1
"PikaHikariKT I should've taken a picture of the hat of shame, then.",1
I have no idea why she takes delight in torturing that poor man but it's amazing,1
"Also there's the fact that she makes MacCready wear the ""hat of shame"" for ""being a turd in Fallout 3""",1
Y'know the really dumb decisions that you try not to make in games? She makes all of them because why not,1
I think watching my sister play fallout 4 might be just as fun as playing it if not more.,1
Sleepy kitty. ,1
LonerDreamer wellllll actually you can't change his clothes until his exile apparently. danse',1
LonerDreamer I will definitely take pictures.,1
my sister says she's gonna dress everyone like that. ,1
there are tears. his legs look lovely. ,1
GenevieveVerso Shardfox theWitchElf MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos wow. Such class.,1
GenevieveVerso Shardfox theWitchElf MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos what does he think about Hancock's sparkling personality?,1
GenevieveVerso Shardfox theWitchElf MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos that's terrible! Why would he do such a thing?,1
GenevieveVerso Shardfox theWitchElf MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos actually she hasn't gotten there yet.,1
GenevieveVerso Shardfox theWitchElf MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos this is what she's wearing ,1
GenevieveVerso Shardfox theWitchElf MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos was let off early. I'm watching my sister fail fallout,1
WHY DOESNT SHE EVER SNUGGLE WITH ME LIKE THIS ,1
GenevieveVerso Shardfox theWitchElf MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos ugh. No.,1
This is Tallahassee. ,1
BattleMonkeyz sounds like a party,1
atmora too tired,1
BattleMonkeyz ugh you have no idea how dead it was.,1
BattleMonkeyz my boss told me to take a nap for her. Imight actually do that.,1
BattleMonkeyz actually my boss let me go home.,1
At long last hell has released me.,1
LacTheWatcher that ain't a diploma. that's a diploma /frame/,1
I am in hellllllllll ,1
azarkansero Shardfox theWitchElf MissLusyd TheFuxedos I'm like 60% sure I'm leaving early again. It's noon and no one is here.,1
Shardfox theWitchElf MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos we have one guy in the store rn. One guy.,1
Shardfox theWitchElf MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos you too? We're having a sale and it's failing miserably,1
Shardfox theWitchElf MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos please keep them rolling it's the only thing keeping me awake right now.,1
MissLusyd Shardfox theWitchElf azarkansero TheFuxedos ugh I'd join in but I'm multitasking.,1
MissLusyd Shardfox theWitchElf azarkansero TheFuxedos ...have I told you that I love you already? Because I do.,1
MissLusyd Shardfox theWitchElf azarkansero TheFuxedos how long are we gonna keep the car thing up?,1
MissLusyd azarkansero theWitchElf Shardfox TheFuxedos we are pretty hot aren't we?,1
MissLusyd azarkansero theWitchElf Shardfox TheFuxedos I would marry us.,1
I may be falling asleep. ,1
MissLusyd Shardfox theWitchElf azarkansero TheFuxedos oooof course you did.,1
BattleMonkeyz a medical school bookstore run by the state.,1
BattleMonkeyz a medical school bookstore run by the state.,1
MissLusyd Shardfox theWitchElf azarkansero TheFuxedos ...where..HOW did you find that?,1
BattleMonkeyz eh we had a good sale last week so eh?,1
"""I'm running away and never coming back"" ""Ok. I'm burning down the store, is that okay?"" ""Pshh I get paid regardless, so sure""",1
Shardfox theWitchElf MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos that screenshot says it all. Beautiful.,1
theWitchElf MissLusyd Shardfox azarkansero TheFuxedos it honestly looks like the car equivalent of a tricycle,1
theWitchElf MissLusyd Shardfox azarkansero TheFuxedos look I didn't even know~loving~ cars was possible til last night.,1
theWitchElf Shardfox MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos omaigawd that's awesome.,1
"I told my boss it MIGHT be the worst sale ever and she's like ""whaddya mean MIGHT be. If I fall asleep, you can hit me""",1
ohmaigawd this is the worst sale in the history of sales.,1
theWitchElf Shardfox MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos i honestly don't know what that is.,1
"MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos I'm just sorry I missed the really great/terrible ones. Ah, well. I had to sleep.",1
Sooooo...the sale is a complete failure.,1
michaelianblack: People online are so much more cautious about revealing movie spoilers than they are about calling each other racial e…,1
LOLGOP: Trump basically wants to be the president of Russia.,1
UncleYo: This is the first time in history that Star Wars and Christmas have been said together without collective groaning.,1
I feel oodles better. Still not 100% but some recovery is better than no recovery.,1
MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos I wake up to a bunch of car puns. You guys are great.,1
Back to bed. Night folks.,1
MissLusyd sorry. I'm on a diet and my mother is being my enforcer. *sigh*,1
MissLusyd oh yeah. That too.,1
Awwww my kitty wants in. Guess my parents don't give enough belly rubs.,1
"MissLusyd my mother would take one look at that and be like ""that's too many calories why are you drinking that?""",1
"MissLusyd """"""""""""""""""""""healthy""""""""""""""""""""",1
MissLusyd Tory_B_Martin azarkansero seriously I'll probably be back in an hour. My insomnia is predictable,1
MissLusyd Tory_B_Martin azarkansero and with that. I should go to bed. I'll probably be awake in a couple of hours. It happens.,1
MissLusyd Tory_B_Martin azarkansero TheFuxedos I should be sorry. I'm not. This was a great way to spend a Thursday night.,1
Tory_B_Martin MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos that was the plan actually,1
MissLusyd azarkansero yup. Guess I'm staying up.,1
MissLusyd azarkansero actually not the weirdest thing I've heard of after the car conversation,1
MissLusyd azarkansero I should go to bed but I probably won't.,1
MissLusyd azarkansero weird-er I suppose,1
azarkansero MissLusyd THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO BE KNOWN FOR,1
MissLusyd azarkansero I got one too ,1
azarkansero MissLusyd TheFuxedos fine. I'd fuck a Lexus.,1
azarkansero MissLusyd TheFuxedos I am a CHILLLD,1
azarkansero MissLusyd TheFuxedos I am TOO PURE to disclose this information,1
"MissLusyd azarkansero or...""Sinnin' wagon""? :D",1
MissLusyd azarkansero TheFuxedos this might be the strangest conversation of my 24 1/2 years of life,1
"MissLusyd azarkansero ""Danny if you could fuck a car, what would you fuck?""",1
MissLusyd azarkansero ...actually The pure thing is mostly an act. Mostly.,1
MissLusyd azarkansero TOOO PURE I AM.,1
azarkansero MissLusyd that is a door we should leave locked.,1
MissLusyd azarkansero NO. I AM TOO PURE TO SEE IT,1
MissLusyd azarkansero I'm surprised there isn't actual footage of this. Guys really do love their cars. No. I don't want to actually see,1
MissLusyd azarkansero what if the Volkswagen doesn't get his motor running?,1
MissLusyd azarkansero well I assume he's dead.,1
azarkansero MissLusyd oh god what is wrong with us the tears are back,1
MissLusyd azarkansero yeah but I mean fatally exploding.,1
azarkansero MissLusyd yup. I can see it.,1
MissLusyd azarkansero MAYBE HE LIKES THE DANGER OF STICKING HIS DICK IN SOMETHING THAT MIGHT EXPLODE,1
MissLusyd azarkansero unless the condom is also metal with some sort of insulation coating,1
MissLusyd azarkansero oh god I'm crying,1
MissLusyd azarkansero wouldn't that like...I dunno..burn a dick off?,1
MissLusyd azarkansero wait. Is the car on during the banging?,1
azarkansero MissLusyd I started at exhaust and then my brain died.,1
"MissLusyd azarkansero I dunno if we can top ""burnin' rubber""",1
MissLusyd azarkansero you are REALLY good at this,1
azarkansero MissLusyd for my own personal amusement you should do this,1
azarkansero MissLusyd oh my god. Block that boy asap,1
azarkansero MissLusyd wait. What. This is why I don't do facebook,1
MissLusyd azarkansero I can't taste food atm so everything is meh,1
MissLusyd azarkansero nah it's a whole conversion process. I assume. I dunno.,1
azarkansero MissLusyd nope. That is a public service. The opposite of sin.,1
azarkansero MissLusyd yes. I am a sinnamon roll without the sin.,1
azarkansero MissLusyd I'm too pure and innocent to generate sin so idk,1
azarkansero WHY CANT YOU TUNE TO C LIKE A NORMAL PERSON,1
azarkansero MissLusyd I AM SO BORED GUYS,1
azarkansero like the whole b flat thing? A transposing nightmare.,1
"azarkansero yeaaaaaah I am the worst brass player in the history of brass players. Thing is, you guys are tuned differently and it THROWSME",1
azarkansero string instruments are a series of half and whole steps. If you know the string names you're halfway there.,1
azarkansero otherwise it seems braggy,1
"azarkansero thing is, it's very misleading. I feel the need to explain that if you know one string instrument you know most of them.",1
azarkansero I can't stress enough how mediocre I am music wise.,1
azarkansero like I said. Not really impressive.,1
azarkansero I was a music Ed major like four years ago. That's why. Also I have a mezzo soprano vocal range.,1
"azarkansero a mandolin is a violin with frets. I also play guitar, piano, and I've been instructed in trumpet and baritone",1
"azarkansero Violin, viola, cello, and bass. All part of the same family",1
azarkansero it's a lot less impressive than it sounds. Seriously.,1
azarkansero I used to doodle but I got in trouble for it.,1
"azarkansero can't write, never trained properly to draw. I'm a mediocre musician who can barely play 9 instruments. Can't contribute much.",1
MissLusyd ah. I dislike the taste of alcohol so I never drink.,1
azarkansero eh. She kinda blended in the background to me.,1
azarkansero I found a one shot that explored it and I wanted it to be longer. It's a shame I can't write.,1
"MissLusyd don't get too hammered, mmkay?",1
"azarkansero ah, Tumblr. Well, I dot see too much about piper but I see a LOT of Hancock",1
azarkansero also it's possible the SS met Prewar Nick since she was a lawyer,1
azarkansero I reallyreally wanted to romance Nick though. It fits. He's out of time...she's out of time.,1
azarkansero Tbh I WAS gonna romance Macready but Hancock won me over,1
azarkansero ughhhh I was so mad,1
azarkansero *boring,1
azarkansero Hancock is second and I'll use Deacon and Piper a lot. Macready complains too much and the others are prong,1
azarkansero Nick. Nick is the best. Hands down. I'm only romancing Hancock because Nick is unavailable.,1
BattleMonkeyz yeah there's only three of us and 2 registers.,1
azarkansero she's so funny.,1
"azarkansero I'm actually a pretty silent player. I'll yell at companions and talk to the screen but my sister should stream, tbh.",1
BattleMonkeyz yes less shit is good. Hopefully I'm not running the sale solo like last week.,1
azarkansero it was less badass because a) she's wearing the outfit with yellow shorts and b) she screams a lot,1
MissLusyd ...having fun? :D,1
"BattleMonkeyz had to go home early because I felt like shit. I rested, still feel like shit but less shit.",1
BattleMonkeyz trying to get healthy before the big sale tomorrow.,1
Arcadyagami I CANT STOP PLAYING. There's so much todo.,1
"azarkansero she's level 5, has no ammo and armed with a machete.",1
azarkansero I'm jealous. I was watching my sister play for awhile which was probably the funniest thing I've seen in awhile.,1
"So since I have been cut off from Fallout 4, I have nothing to do. What's up guys?",1
"I don't think I can sit through Hayden Christensen's acting ever again. I'm sorry, father.",1
"But my dad INSISTS we watch the prequels because ""we must prepare"".",1
Of course I'll join once they start the original.,1
"So my sister is home and my dad has roped her into watching all six Star Wars movies. In ""chronological"" order. Hahahahahaha",1
MissLusyd GenevieveVerso Tory_B_Martin TheFuxedos aw damn. I always miss the fun stuff.,1
GenevieveVerso MissLusyd Tory_B_Martin TheFuxedos what'd I miss?,1
Who's a pretty girl? You are! You are! ,1
MissLusyd Tauri3l TheFuxedos tskimoongoddess azarkansero I'm surprised it was still in one piece after that.,1
MissLusyd Tauri3l TheFuxedos tskimoongoddess azarkansero I dunno I'm not too big on thrift store chic,1
MissLusyd Tauri3l TheFuxedos tskimoongoddess azarkansero oh god I bet it felt good to get rid of that asshole.,1
MissLusyd Tauri3l TheFuxedos tskimoongoddess azarkansero sweeeeeet,1
MissLusyd Tauri3l TheFuxedos tskimoongoddess azarkansero oh god we can do that?,1

MissLusyd haha well ironically I'm stuck at a medical school bookstore and we have none of that in our drug section.,1
MissLusyd I have no idea. My throat hurts too. I think it's dry sinus or something since I feel pressure and junk.,1
I asked to go home but I never got a straight answer. Welp. Guess I'm staying here.,1
I'm not even sniffly. the top of my nose feels raw when I breathe through it and it's miserable.,1
My sinuses hate me.,1
My sinuses hate me.,1

my boss and I are terrible terrible people.,1
MaraWritesStuff not unless they were trying to hit on you,1
BattleMonkeyz also they were tiny.,1
"BattleMonkeyz couple of years ago, me and my sister made a snow couple and they lasted a day.",1
BattleMonkeyz if we ever do get snow there won't BE enough for a snowman. ;w;,1
BattleMonkeyz *sobs* i just want winter sosososo bad.,1
BattleMonkeyz I feel like I need a shower every time I step outside. it ain't pleasant.,1
Megafighter3 I WAS JUST BEING FRIENDLY AND SHE GOT OFFENDED.,1
Megafighter3 Like..we weren't even arguing about anything. I was just being silly and she thought I was being condescending.,1
"BattleMonkeyz In the swamp, it's hot, humid, wet, and gross all year round.,",1
BattleMonkeyz yeah we're just now getting around to the hot side of fall.,1
BattleMonkeyz hahaha it's 63 degrees outside. I'm still running the AC on full blast.,1
"ProfessorOtaku yeah, that was our reaction as well. I can't wait to get out of retail.",1
BattleMonkeyz it's too wet to run here. :(,1
"ProfessorOtaku ""maybe..uh..you came off as condescending?""",1
"ProfessorOtaku ""wait...that's ALL you said? Really?""",1
ProfessorOtaku yeah she was kinda dumbfounded when I told her about it.,1
"My boss was like ""Eh.. I didn't see it as offensive but you kinda need to watch your tone sometimes""",1
"BattleMonkeyz Still getting fat. Hahaha. But yes, you're right.",1
Like.. she was truly offended.,1
Holy CRAP lady I was trying to be funny.,1
BattleMonkeyz I make $8.87 an hour. It's not really a fortune.,1
"A customer asked me what ink was on sale. I said ""Ink? HP Ink!"" and she's like ""I know it's HP Ink I'm not STUPID""",1
I was trying to be funny and friendly and it blew up in my face. Turns out I came off as condescending.,1
BattleMonkeyz hahahah actually I'm doing pretty awful but thanks.,1
"Another day, another offended customer.",1
I wonder why certain groups are against this. Isn't it common sense? it's not like they're taking them away. ,1
BattleMonkeyz calvin yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees,1
Too tired to play video games. Is this a part of this quarter life crisis I keep hearing about?,1

ErinSmi14035528 dude I love Danse but only because of the Buzz Lightyear memes.,1
"ErinSmi14035528 God no. I'm never that bold, not even on the Internet. Besides, I'm more of a Nick Valentine fangirl myself.",1
ErinSmi14035528 Tauri3l fallenangel460 I think they're funny despite me being scared of them.,1
ErinSmi14035528 Tauri3l fallenangel460 eh honestly I can only speak for myself. Not gonna lie though...some of the Ghoulettes scare me,1
"ErinSmi14035528 Tauri3l fallenangel460 Please, I'm the least scary person ever.",1
ErinSmi14035528 TheFuxedos fallenangel460 I'm more of a lurker than a participator but the Ghoulettes are a special kind of people.,1

Look lady. I am TRYING to stay busy. You're not helping.,1
"Example: you're trying to stay busy and she says ""Oh, you're STILL not done with that?""",1
What's the least offensive way to ask your boss to stop being condescending?,1

SW1128 I think ASB is the cheapest broker and it's a minimum $30 per trade. Smart shares you pay a percentage of your investment no minimum,0
SW1128 but the smart money is always on index funds. A Random Walk Down Wall Street is a good book to read,0
SW1128 low as costs due to the fact they're all index funds. Minimum $500 buy in. Minimum $50 regular contribution,0
SW1128 and yea smart shares is the shit. If you're wanting to get into individual stock picking though it's not suitable,0
SW1128 a few rules of thumb are typically all you need,0
